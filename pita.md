## Pita

https://www.mygreekdish.com/recipe/the-easiest-homemade-pita-bread/

### Ingredients

- 1500–1590g (17-18.5 oz.) strong white bread flour or 150% white and 50% whole-wheat flour
- 1080 g (38 oz.) lukewarm (40C/ 104F)
- 9 tsp dry instant yeast
- 3 tsp salt 
- 3 tsp sugar  


### Instructions

* To prepare this pitta bread recipe add in a mixer’s bowl the **yeast**, **sugar** and **water** and blend to dissolve the yeast. Set aside for 5-10 minutes until yeast froths.

* Add the **flour** and **salt** and mix using the dough hook for 6-8 minutes.  Alternatively you could mix the ingredients by hand. 

* Depending on the flour used, the dough may need a little bit less or more flour than this pita bread recipe calls for. After mixing for a while the dough for your pita bread should become an elastic ball and a bit sticky.

* When ready, coat the dough with olive oil, place in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap and a kitchen towel. **Let it sit in a warm place**, for at least 20 minutes or until it **doubles its size**. This is an important step for this pita bread recipe. The first proof makes the pita bread fluffy and soft. If it is winter, turn the oven on for a minute or two, until it’s a little warm, switch it off and then let the dough rise in it.

* Take the dough out of the bowl and **gently deflate** with your hands. Use just a tiny bit of flour to help you if it is too sticky. Split into **18 evenly sized balls** around 145g/5 oz. each.

* Let the pita bread balls rest for 15 minutes before shaping. This is the second proof and will allow your dough to relax and become easier to shape.

* To form the pita bread, you can either use a rolling pin, or **stretch it** with your hands, about **20cm in diameter**. A rolling pin will make a crunchier pita, while hand stretching a softer, fluffier one. If the dough springs back, set it aside for a few minutes to rest and then continue rolling again.

* For a more traditional look on your pita bread, **press the dough firmly with your fingertips forming dimples** or use a fork to make some holes on top.

* Heat a non-sticking frying pan to medium heat and add just a little bit of olive oil and wipe off any excess. Bake each pita bread for about 3 minutes on each side, until slightly coloured and still soft. If your pan has a lid, **place the lid on while baking** them to keep the moisture in.

* Sprinkle on sea salt, oregano, and a very light brushing of olive oil as a binder.
